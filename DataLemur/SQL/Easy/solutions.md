Q1) Histogram of Tweets
Twitter SQL Interview Question
This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.
```
tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp
```
tweets Example Input:
```
tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
214252	111	Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	111	Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	111	Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	254	If the salary is so competitive why won’t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	148	I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00
```
Example Output:
```
tweet_bucket	users_num
1	2
2	1
```
<br>

Solution:
```
with userGrpBy as (
    select user_id, count(*) as 'IndividualTCount'
    from tweets
    where year(tweet_date) = 2022
    group by 1)
    
    
select IndividualTCount as tweet_bucket, count(*) as users_num
from userGrpBy
group by 1;

```




Q1)  Average Post Hiatus (Part 1)
Facebook SQL Interview Question
<br>
Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each user’s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

p.s. If you've read the Ace the Data Science Interview and liked it, consider writing us a review?

posts Table:
```
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_content	text
post_date	timestamp
```

posts Example Input:
```
user_id	post_id	post_content	post_date
151652	599415	Need a hug	07/10/2021 12:00:00
661093	624356	Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend	07/29/2021 13:00:00
004239	784254	Happy 4th of July!	07/04/2021 11:00:00
661093	442560	Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me.	07/08/2021 14:00:00
151652	111766	I'm so done with covid - need travelling ASAP!	07/12/2021 19:00:00
```
Example Output:
```
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21
```

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Link https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-average-post-hiatus-1

Solution: 

```
SELECT user_id, datediff(  Max(date(post_date)), Min(date(post_date))  ) as days_between
FROM posts
where year(post_date)=2021
group by 1
having count(*)>1;
```
<br>
<br>
Notes : 

```
You can use 2 aggregate functions in group by | and not mention it in Select and mention it in Having clause directly just to save another CTE
```

Q2) Teams Power Users
Microsoft SQL Interview Question
<br>
Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption:

No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.
messages Table:
```
Column Name	Type
message_id	integer
sender_id	integer
receiver_id	integer
content	varchar
sent_date	datetime
```
messages Example Input:
```
message_id	sender_id	receiver_id	content	sent_date
901	3601	4500	You up?	08/03/2022 00:00:00
902	4500	3601	Only if you're buying	08/03/2022 00:00:00
743	3601	8752	Let's take this offline	06/14/2022 00:00:00
922	3601	4500	Get on the call	08/10/2022 00:00:00
```
Example Output:
```
sender_id	message_count
3601	2
4500	1
```


Link https://datalemur.com/questions/teams-power-users

Solution: 

```
SELECT sender_id, count(*)
FROM messages
-- where year(sent_date)= 2022 and month(sent_date)= 08    Doenst work in Postgre  SQL
where sent_date between '2022-08-01' and '2022-08-31'

group by 1
order by count(*)  desc
limit 2;
```

Q3)  Duplicate Job Listings
LinkedIn SQL Interview Question
<br>
This is the same question as problem #8 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Definition:

Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions.
job_listings Table:
```
Column Name	Type
job_id	integer
company_id	integer
title	string
description	string
```
job_listings Example Input:
```
job_id	company_id	title	description
248	827	Business Analyst	Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organizations.
149	845	Business Analyst	Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organizations.
945	345	Data Analyst	Data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a business's customers and ways the data can be used to solve problems.
164	345	Data Analyst	Data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a business's customers and ways the data can be used to solve problems.
172	244	Data Engineer	Data engineer works in a variety of settings to build systems that collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information for data scientists and business analysts to interpret.
```
Example Output:
```
duplicate_companies
1
```

      having count(*)>1

) 

select count(company_id) 'duplicate_companies' from tempCount;
