Twitter SQL Interview Question
This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.
```
tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp
```
tweets Example Input:
```
tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
214252	111	Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	111	Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00

Q4)  Unfinished Parts
Tesla SQL Interview QuestionI
<br>
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table
```
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly
```

Example Input
```
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper	NULL	3
bumper	NULL	4
```


Example Output
```
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4
```

Q5) Laptop vs. Mobile Viewership
NY Times SQL Interview Question

<br>

IMP 
```
***
```

This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.

viewership Table
```
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
```
viewership Example Input
```
user_id	device_type	view_time
123	tablet	01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	laptop	01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	laptop	02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
```
Example Output
```

Q12)  Final Account Balance
PayPal SQL Interview Question
<br>
Given a table containing information about bank deposits and withdrawals made using Paypal, write a query to retrieve the final account balance for each account, taking into account all the transactions recorded in the table with the assumption that there are no missing transactions.

transactions Table:
```
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
account_id	integer
amount	decimal
transaction_type	varchar
```
transactions Example Input:
```
transaction_id	account_id	amount	transaction_type
123	101	10.00	Deposit
124	101	20.00	Deposit
125	101	5.00	Withdrawal
126	201	20.00	Deposit
128	201	10.00	Withdrawal
```
Example Output:
```
account_id	final_balance
101	25.00
201	10.00
```
Using account ID 101 as an example, $30.00 was deposited into this account, while $5.00 was withdrawn. Therefore, the final account balance can be calculated as the difference between the total deposits and withdrawals which is $30.00 - $5.00, resulting in a final balance of $25.00.

Link https://datalemur.com/questions/final-account-balance

Solution: 

```
with normalized_amnt as (SELECT *, case 

when transaction_type ='Withdrawal' then amount*-1
when transaction_type ='Deposit' then amount

end as new_amount

FROM transactions)


select account_id, sum(new_amount) as final_balance from normalized_amnt

GROUP by 1;
